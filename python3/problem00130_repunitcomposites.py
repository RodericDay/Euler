[See 129]

You are given that for all primes, p > 5, that p âˆ’ 1 is divisible by A(p).
For example, when p = 41, A(41) = 5, and 40 is divisible by 5.

However, there are rare composite values for which this is also true; the first
five examples being 91, 259, 451, 481, and 703.

Find the sum of the first twenty-five composite values of n for which
GCD(n, 10) = 1 and n âˆ’ 1 is divisible by A(n).
